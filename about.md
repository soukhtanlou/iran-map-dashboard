# About Iran's Atlas of Provincial Development Indicators

## Introduction
Statistical data is a cornerstone for **policymaking**, **planning**, guiding executive actions, and monitoring programs. At the governance level, the *Statistical Centre of Iran (SCI)* is responsible for compiling data tied to economic, social, and cultural development goals, alongside creating descriptive and analytical indicators at national and regional levels.

## Purpose
This dashboard, named *Iran’s Atlas of Provincial Development Indicators*, is an **analytical tool** designed to offer users insights into comparing provincial development levels. It aims to support planning and prioritize policymaking, particularly for human development in less privileged regions.

## Data Source
The data comes from the report *"Economic, Social, and Cultural Status of Provinces"*, covering statistics from **2019 to 2023**. It’s organized into **24 main categories** and their sub-indicators, available as **open-source** resources for researchers, planners, and citizens.

## Features
A curated selection of this data is visualized through:
- **Dynamic maps** for inter-provincial comparisons across years.
- **Line charts** to compare national and provincial trends.
- **Data tables** for detailed insights.  
These indicators are valid, reliable, timely, interpretable, and comparable, enabling diverse analyses for development-focused provincial comparisons.
